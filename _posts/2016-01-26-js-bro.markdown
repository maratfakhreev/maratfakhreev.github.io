With this "comment" icon I want to present you some new section of my blog. Although this is not a section, but rather a new articles format, short "minds" about development and developer live.
</br>
Let's start :)

Actually I do not like such tests on "true" developer, but you should know that every language has a lot of stupid, non-obvious questions/issues for the interview or for when you need to make fun of a colleague :)

Not so long time ago I found a seemingly obvious code and called it a "test for my jsBro".

```javascript
var are = {
  you: function(callback) {
    callback();
  }
}

var my = {
  jsBro: function() {
    console.log(this);
  }
}

are.you(my.jsBro);
```

So, what returns the last line, what is the value of `this`? And the last question, are you my jsBro?
</br>
If you have answered correctly, then surely it is :)
